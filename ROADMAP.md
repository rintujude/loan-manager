# Project Roadmap

This document outlines potential enhancements and changes that could be made to the project in the future.

## Feature Enhancements

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain endpoints.
-  **User Management Module**:
    1. **User Activity Logging**
     - Implement user activity logging to track all loan details and user activities associated with each user.
     - Log actions such as schedule creation, schedule retrieval, user authentication, and any other relevant user interactions.
     - Store logged activities in a dedicated database table with fields for user ID, action type, timestamp, and additional details as needed.

    2. **User Profile Integration**
     - Integrate user profiles with loan details to establish a direct association between users and their respective activities.
     - Enhance user profiles to include attributes such as contact information, role-based permissions, and preferences.
     - Ensure that user authentication and authorization mechanisms are tightly coupled with user profiles to maintain data integrity and security.
    3. **Audit Trail and Reporting**
   - Implement an audit trail feature to allow administrators to review user activities and track changes made to loan schedules.
   - Provide reporting capabilities to generate custom reports on user activities, such as the number of schedules created per user, most active users, etc.
   - Enhance reporting with filtering, sorting, and export options to facilitate data analysis and decision-making.
    4. **User Engagement and Notifications**
   - Enhance user engagement by providing personalized notifications and alerts based on user activities and preferences.
   - Notify users about important events such as schedule updates, payment reminders, and account security notifications.
   - Offer communication channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notifications) for users to interact with the system and stay informed about their loan details.
     
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative error messages and proper HTTP status codes.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing schedules to improve performance when dealing with large datasets.
- **Search and Filtering**: Add support for searching and filtering schedules based on various criteria such as date, amount, etc.
- **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages for API responses by implementing internationalization (i18n) support.
- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load for frequently accessed data.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Generate API documentation using Swagger to provide a more interactive and user-friendly interface for developers.
- **Security Enhancements**: Enhance security measures such as implementing HTTPS, CSRF protection, and securing sensitive data.

## Technical Improvements

- **Code Refactoring**: Refactor code to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Increase unit test coverage to ensure comprehensive testing of all components and functionalities.
- **Integration Testing**: Expand integration test coverage to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks to improve overall system performance.
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to ensure compatibility with the latest versions and security patches.
- **Containerization**: Dockerize the application for easier deployment and scaling in containerized environments.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Future Features

- **User Dashboard**: Create a user dashboard to provide users with insights into their loan schedules, payments, etc.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate with payment gateways to facilitate online payments and automate payment processing.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize loan parameters, repayment options, etc., to meet their specific requirements.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for convenient access to loan schedules and management on mobile devices.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Provide analytics and reporting features to track loan performance, trends, etc.
- **Machine Learning**: Explore the use of machine learning for predicting loan defaults, optimizing repayment strategies, etc.
